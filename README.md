Project Title: Speed Racer: A Python-Based Car Racing Game
Objective: To develop an interactive car racing game using Python and the Pygame library. 
The game will feature basic racing mechanics, score tracking, and increasing difficulty levels to engage players.

The concept of car racing games has been popular in the gaming industry for decades. Our project aims to leverage Python's 
simplicity and the power of the Pygame library to create a fun and educational experience. 
Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games, making it an ideal choice for this project.

The game will include the following features:
1.	Basic Car Movement: The player will control a car using keyboard inputs.
2.	Obstacles and Collision Detection: The game will have obstacles that the player must avoid.
3.	Score Tracking: Points will be awarded based on the player's performance.
4.	Increasing Difficulty: The game will progressively become more challenging as the player advances.
5.	User Interface: A simple menu and score display.


By following the outlined steps, developers can create similar games and expand upon this foundation to include more advanced features such as multiple levels and power-ups.
