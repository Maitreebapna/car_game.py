Project Title: Speed Racer: A Python-Based Car Racing Game
Objective: To develop an interactive car racing game using Python and the Pygame library. 
The game will feature basic racing mechanics, score tracking, and increasing difficulty levels to engage players.

The concept of car racing games has been popular in the gaming industry for decades. Our project aims to leverage Python's 
simplicity and the power of the Pygame library to create a fun and educational experience. 
Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games, making it an ideal choice for this project.
